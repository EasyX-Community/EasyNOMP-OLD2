### Helping give NOMP & BootNOMP new life, with some style!
***LeshaCat:*** _"[EasyX-Community/EasyNOMP](https://github.com/EasyX-Community/EasyNOMP) is built for the [EasyX Community](http://www.easyx.info/) & [Pool](http://easyxpool.tk/). EasyNOMP is based off of [1301313Y/BootNOMP](https://github.com/1301313Y/BootNOMP). It's focus is to add patches, bug fixes, features, and quality documentation to BootNOMP to make it easy to install. BootNOMP gives NOMP a sleek looking new design, and fully re-designed and re-coded user interface! I saw the original dev working on BootNOMP and the source code and figured I could lend a hand. I have plans to rework the documentation, Block Explorer, Docker source, and some various configuration options. I decided a hard fork would be best suited. If you would like to contribute, please consider looking at the parent project [1301313Y/BootNOMP](https://github.com/1301313Y/BootNOMP) and original project [foxer666/node-open-mining-portal](https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal) first, as these two guys are the only ones who are helping get the NOMP rebirthing process started."_
