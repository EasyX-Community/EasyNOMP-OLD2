## OPEN BOUNTIES:

EasyNOMP needs an android & ios app, as well as a new design...

- negotiate $ - Web UI design change (menu, charts, graphs, guages, etc.)

- negotiate $ - NATIVE android app to access API and display stats in its own mobile design. APPS MUST be native, I will not accept web browser apps.

You will need to send example work of yours (your portfolio) and screenshots of current projects.

To apply please create an issue ticket!
